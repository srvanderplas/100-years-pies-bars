"Graphical Perception: Theory, Experimentation, and Application to the Development of Graphical Methods	1984	Cleveland & McGill	1. Our approach is based on graphical perception-the visual decoding of information encoded on graphs-and it includes both theory and experimentation to test the theor; 2. The first part is an identification of a set of elementary perceptual tasks that are carried out when people extract quantitative information from graphs. The second part is an ordering of the tasks on the basis of how accurately people perform them	1. Neither pie nor bar. Dot plot (Lolipop) better 2. position judgments were more accurate than length judgments and angle judgment	""In the ordering of perceptual tasks", length judgments are hypothesized to be more accurate than area judgments," which in turn are hypothesized to be more accurate than volume judgments. This ordering is based on a combination of psychophysical theory and experimental results.""	1. Error: Seventy-eight percent of the large errors occurred for the length judgments. Eighty-eight percent of the large errors occurred for the angle judgments	",,,,,,,
