# 100 Years of Pie vs Bar Charts

This project presents a comprehensive summary and re-analysis of over 100 years of research comparing pie charts and bar charts in graphical perception studies. It consolidates findings from historical and contemporary tests to examine the circumstances and rationale behind the superior efficacy of one chart type over another.

For over 100 years, people have debated whether pie charts or bar charts are better at helping us understand numbers. This project dives into that debate by exploring old and new research on how people interpret different kinds of charts. It's like looking back at dozens of experiments where people were asked to figure out how big one slice of a pie chart is or which bar is taller --- and seeing what those results tell us today.

We summarize key studies that looked at things like speed, accuracy, and user preference when comparing pies and bars. Sometimes pie charts were surprisingly good, especially when people were estimating proportions like "What percentage is this?" But when it came to comparing values, bar charts were almost always better. Our goal is to show that the best chart depends on the kind of task you're asking someone to do --- not just on looks or tradition.

This project brings together findings from psychology, statistics, and data visualization. We use graphs, side-by-side examples, and summary tables to help explain what the research says. Whether you're a data scientist or just someone who enjoys clear communication, this review helps you understand when to use a pie or a bar chart --- and why.
