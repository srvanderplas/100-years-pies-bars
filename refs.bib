Increasing our basic understanding of graphical perception will allow us to make graphs that convey quantitative information to viewers with more accuracy and efficiency. This paper describes an experiment that was conducted to investigate the accuracy of six basic judgments of graphical perception. Two types of position judgments were found to be the most accurate, length judgments were second, angle and slope judgments were third, and area judgments were last. Distance between judged objects was found to be a factor in the accuracy of the basic judgments.},

The last decade, in particular, has shown an increase in perception-based visualization research studies. With all of this recent progress, the visualization community lacks a comprehensive guide to contextualize their results. In this report, we provide a systematic and comprehensive review of research studies on perception related to visualization. This survey reviews perception-focused visualization studies since 1980 and summarizes their research developments focusing on low-level tasks, further breaking techniques down by visual encoding and visualization type. In particular, we focus on how perception is used to evaluate the effectiveness of visualizations, to help readers understand and apply the principles of perception of their visualization designs through a task-optimized approach. We concluded our report with a summary of the weaknesses and open research questions in the area.},

	abstract = {Previous research is equivocal regarding the most effective methods of presenting quantitative information displays. The differences in results may be due to numerous reasons including the display and inquiry type. This study examines several methods of displaying quantitative information (e.g., line graphs, line grables, bar charts, bar grables, tables, pie charts and pie grables) that were factorially crossed with different kinds of data extraction inquiries (i.e., questions about exact numerical quantities, comparisons, and trends). Grables are displays that combines features of graphs and tables including specific numerical information with each graphically presented category. Results showed that tables, bar grables and line grables produced the fewest errors, and line graphs and bar charts produced the fastest responses across question types. Error rates combining the accuracy and time (i.e., errors/s) were lowest for the three grables and table. Results are discussed with respect to prior theoretical work and the potential benefits of hybrid forms of quantitative displays for multiple kinds of data extraction inquiries. Relevance to industry Choosing the best method of displaying information is important for effective decision making. This study evaluates seven types of graphical displays to answer three types of inquiries. Results indicate that in general, the most efficient data extraction (fewest errors per unit time) were produced using grable or table displays across question types. The appropriate display fosters better communication of information.},
