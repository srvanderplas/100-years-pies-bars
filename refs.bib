This survey reviews perception-focused visualization studies since 1980 and summarizes their research developments focusing on low-level tasks, further breaking techniques down by visual encoding and visualization type. In particular, we focus on how perception is used to evaluate the effectiveness of visualizations, to help readers understand and apply the principles of perception of their visualization designs through a task-optimized approach.

The differences in results may be due to numerous reasons including the display and inquiry type. This study examines several methods of displaying quantitative information (e.g., line graphs, line grables, bar charts, bar grables, tables, pie charts and pie grables) that were factorially crossed with different kinds of data extraction inquiries (i.e., questions about exact numerical quantities, comparisons, and trends). Grables are displays that combines features of graphs and tables including specific numerical information with each graphically presented category. Results showed that tables, bar grables and line grables produced the fewest errors, and line graphs and bar charts produced the fastest responses across question types. Error rates combining the accuracy and time (i.e., errors/s) were lowest for the three grables and table. Results are discussed with respect to prior theoretical work and the potential benefits of hybrid forms of quantitative displays for multiple kinds of data extraction inquiries. Relevance to industry Choosing the best method of displaying information is important for effective decision making. This study evaluates seven types of graphical displays to answer three types of inquiries. Results indicate that in general, the most efficient data extraction (fewest errors per unit time) were produced using grable or table displays across question types. The appropriate display fosters better communication of information.},

In Experiment 1, the data-ink ratios of bar and line graphs affected the accuracy and response times for comparison, difference, and mean questions: the higher the data-ink ratio, the faster the response time and the greater the accuracy. Experiments 2 and 3 showed that the effects of ink in the syntactic elements of a graph depend on the location and function of the element: redundant ink in the indicators had limited effects on performance, pictorial backgrounds generally increased response time and decreased accuracy, y axis tick marks generally increased response time, and the y axis line and the x axis generally decreased response time. The effect of each graphical element was conditional on the type of graph and task and the presence of other graphical elements. The discussion focuses on psychological principles that may underlie the effects of each syntactic element.},

In simulation studies [12] lineups have been shown as being efficient: the power of visual tests is comparable to classical tests while being much less stringent in terms of distributional assumptions made. This makes lineups versatile, yet powerful, tools in situations where conditions for regular statistical tests are not or cannot be met. In this paper we introduce lineups as a tool for evaluating the power of competing graphical designs. We highlight some of the theoretical properties and then show results from two studies evaluating competing designs: both studies are designed to go to the limits of our perceptual abilities to highlight differences between designs. We use both accuracy and speed of evaluation as measures of a successful design. The first study compares the choice of coordinate system: polar versus cartesian coordinates. The results show strong support in favor of cartesian coordinates in finding fast and accurate answers to spotting patterns. The second study is aimed at finding shift differences between distributions. Both studies are motivated by data problems that we have recently encountered, and explore using simulated data to evaluate the plot designs under controlled conditions. Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) is used to conduct the studies. The lineups provide an effective mechanism for objectively evaluating plot designs.},

Previous studies have shown that extreme minimalism is not always best, and that visual embellishments can be useful depending on the context. While more knowledge is being developed regarding the effects of embellishments on users, less attention has been given to the perspectives of practitioners regarding how they design with embellishments. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 data visualization practitioners, investigating how they understand chartjunk and the factors that influence how and when they make use of embellishments. Our investigation uncovers a broad and pluralistic understanding of chartjunk among practitioners, and foregrounds a variety of personal and situated factors that influence the use of chartjunk beyond context. We highlight the personal nature of design practice, and discuss the need for more practice-led research to better understand the ways in which concepts like chartjunk are interpreted and used by practitioners.},

In that time, technological changes have impacted both our charts and our testing methods, resulting in a dizzying array of charts, many different taxonomies to classify graphics, and several different philosophical approaches to testing the efficacy of charts and graphs experimentally. Once rare, charts and graphical displays are now everywhere---but do they help us understand? In this article we review the history of graphical testing across disciplines, discuss different direct approaches to testing graphics, and contrast direct tests with visual inference, which requires that the viewer determine both the question and the answer. Examining the past 100 years of graphical testing, we summarize best practices for creating effective graphics and discuss what the future holds for graphics and empirical testing of interactive statistical visualizations.},

  abstract = {The Statistical Atlases published by the Census Bureau in the late 1800s utilized a number of novel methods for displaying data. In this paper, we examine the use of framed spine and mosaic plots used in two plates of the Statistical Atlas of 1870. We use forensic statistics to recreate the data using available census information, and then use that data to create framed charts using modern plotting methods. We then examine the effectiveness of the framed charts compared to other alternatives with a user study. The data and code for this study are available online.},

  abstract = {Pie and bar charts are commonly used to display percentage or proportional data, but professional data analysts have frowned on the use of the pie chart on the grounds that judgements of area are less accurate than judgements of lenth. Thus the bar chart has been favoured. When the amount of data to be communicated is small, some authorities have advocated the use of properly constructed tables, as another option. The series of experiments reported here suggests that there is little to choose between the pie and the bar chart, with the former enjoying a slight advantage if the required judgement is a complicated one, but that both forms of chart are superior to the table. Thus our results do not support the commonly expressed opinion that pie charts are inferior. An analysis of the nature of the task and a review of the psychophysical literature suggest that the traditional prejudice against the pie chart is misguided.
