# Introduction: Pie vs. Bar — A Century-Long Debate

- Pie and bar charts date back to Playfair (early 1800s).
- Pie charts often criticized as less accurate, yet remain widely used.
- This review explores:
  - Historical experiments and design
  - Task performance comparisons
  - Practical usefulness of each chart type

# Motivation: Why Revisit Pie vs. Bar?

- Effective charts are essential for accurate communication of quantitative data.
- Bar charts consistently outperform pie charts in accuracy, speed, and clarity (based on early research).
- Yet, pie charts remain popular in media, business, and education.
  - This raises key questions:
  - Why do pie charts persist?
  - How do habits, aesthetics, or tradition influence chart selection?

# The Dawn of Empirical Graphics

- Early JASA studies (1926–1930s) by Eells, von Huhn, and Croxton tested pie vs. bar charts for accuracy and speed.
- Tasks varied: Eells used part estimation; Croxton used ratio comparisons like $A/B$, $A+B=1$
- Findings: No clear winner—results depended on task design; von Huhn and Croxton critiqued and refined earlier work.

# Modern Experimental Graphics

![*Visual encodings ordered by perceptual accuracy, as proposed by Cleveland and McGill*](cleveland-mcgill.jpg){width=80% height=200px}

\scriptsize
- The first six activities are listed according to Cleveland and McGill's accuracy tests. Assumed to be far less accurate than the others.


# Modern Experimental Graphics (Cont.)

- Spence & Lewandowsky (1991): Compared A vs. B+C using bar, pie, and table; measured accuracy and speed.
- Peterson (1954): Evaluated 8 chart types for part-whole accuracy; found format matters.
- Simkin & Hastie (1987): Bars better for comparisons; pies better for proportions.
- Skau & Kosara (2016): Pie distortions reduce accuracy; arc cues work best.
- Hill (2025): Bars best for ranking; pies/donuts strong in simple proportion tasks.

# Experimental Description

# Accuracy of Charts

![*Accuracy of Bar Chart By Task Type*](000013.png){width=80% height=200px}

\scriptsize
- Filled dots indicate studies that reported standard errors; hollow dots did not
- Hill (2024) showed the lowest estimation error, indicating the highest accuracy among all studies.
- Studies with Close bar alignment performed better than those with Far bar placement


# Accuracy of Charts (Cont.)

- Heer & Bostock (2010) showed the lowest error, indicating better accuracy with segmented bars.
- Older studies had higher error rates and often lacked standard error reporting (hollow points).

# Accuracy of Charts (Cont.)

- Pie charts perform well for part-to-whole tasks, with low error (1–3%).
- Segment comparisons are harder, showing higher errors (4–6%).
- Recent studies show improved accuracy with better design.

# Result

- Bar charts excel in comparison and ranking tasks — faster, more accurate, and user-preferred.
- Pie charts perform well in part-to-whole and grouped estimation tasks, aligning with intuitive reasoning.
- Task matters: Bar > Pie for $A$ vs $B$; Pie > Bar for $A / (A+B)$; mixed results for $A$ vs $B+C$, $A+B$ vs $C+D$

# Conclusion

:::{.callout-tip title="Conclusion"}
There is no universal winner.
The most effective chart type depends on the specific judgment or task.
:::

- Both chart types remain widely used across science, business, and social sciences.
- The effectiveness of a chart depends on:
  - the task (comparison, estimation, ranking),
  - perceptual features (angle, length, position),
  - and visual design elements ( adjacency, clarity).
- Pie charts are generally better for conveying part-to-whole relationships.
- Bar charts are superior for comparing magnitudes and identifying rankings.
